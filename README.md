This is BorrelNodeJs, also known as a really bad word joke.

## Coding Standard

We're using the [standard][link-cs] code style for Javascript, so no semicolons
and 2 spaces indentation. Furthermore, we're using ES7, because preparing for
the past is something historians do, not software engineers.

## Running the application

First off, install the requirements

```shell
npm install
```

Then, just run it using npm:

```shell
npm start
```

Foreman will handle taking care of launching all instances.
